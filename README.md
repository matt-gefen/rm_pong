# RadiantMoon Pong
## Hello All!
This is a first attempt at diving into the world of C# and Unity Game Development! The bulk of this game is based off of the incredible tutorial found here https://www.awesomeinc.org/tutorials/unity-pong/

I consider this project a fully educational exercise and hope you enjoy my own version of the classic game, Pong!
